# wine-oh!

### GA WDI DC 01 2014, Project 1

### Overview

**[wine-oh!](https://wine-oh.herokuapp.com/)** is a comprehensive wine application designed to allow a user to search for wines, find professional reviews of wines, technical details, price, food pairings, and more.  The application will also allow you to locate a store wihtin your vicinity to purchase. 

[wine-oh!](https://wine-oh.herokuapp.com/) was developed by [Richard Hessler](http://richardhessler.com/) as the first individual project for the inaugural class of the District of Columbia Web Development Immersive course at [General Assemb.ly](https://generalassemb.ly/washington-dc). It was developed over a 5 day sprint and was meant to test what we've learned in the past 5 weeks of class.  This project will continue to be worked on by the sole deleloper, but a branch of the 'finished project' which was presented on May 30, 2014 will remain.

* As a user I should be able to search for a wine and limit my searches by many field: Name, Country, Price, and Color to narrow down the wine I wish to view.
* As a user I should be able to sort my results by quality, price, and vintage, to quickly land upon a wine which works best for me.
* As a user I should be able to view a wines details: reviews(if any), awards(if any), winery notes(if any), scientific specs(if any), and pictures of the wine (if any).
* As a user I should be able to find pairings for a wine if I find one I like so I may be able to enjoy the wine in a meal setting.
* As a user I should be able to log in and if I find a wine I truly enjoyed, I should be able to store it's information for later reference so I may remember what it was and why I liked it.
